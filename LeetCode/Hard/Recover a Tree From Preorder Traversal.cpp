Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal

We run a preorder depth first search on the root of a binary tree.

At each node in this traversal, we output D dashes (where D is the depth of this node), 
then we output the value of this node.  
(If the depth of a node is D, the depth of its immediate child is D+1.  The depth of the root node is 0.)

If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.

Given the output S of this traversal, recover the tree and return its root.
