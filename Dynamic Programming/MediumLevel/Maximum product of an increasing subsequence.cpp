Maximum product of an increasing subsequence
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-product-increasing-subsequence/
Given an array of numbers, find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.

Note: A single number is supposed to be an increasing subsequence of size 1.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = { 3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6 }
Output : 45000
Maximum product is 45000 formed by the 
increasing subsequence 3, 100, 150. Note
that the longest increasing subsequence 
is different {3, 4, 5, 6}

Input : arr[] = { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60 }
Output : 21780000
Maximum product is 21780000 formed by the 
increasing subsequence 10, 22, 33, 50, 60.
