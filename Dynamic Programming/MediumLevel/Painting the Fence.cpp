Painting the Fence
Given a fence with n posts and k colors, find out the number of ways of painting the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color. Since answer can be large return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k.

Output:
Print an integer which denoted the number of ways in which the fence can be painted.(modulo 109 + 7)

Constraints:
1<=T<=1000
1<=n<=100000
1<=k<=100

Example:
Input:
2
2 4
3 2

Output:
16
6
