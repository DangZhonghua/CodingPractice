Given an array arr[] of N integers and a integer K, find the number of subsets of arr[] having XOR of elements as K.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K as described in the problem statement. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the array arr[].

Output:
Corresponding to each test case, print a single line containing an integer denoting the total number of subsets of arr[] having XOR of thier elements as K.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=N<=20
1<=K<=100
0<=arr[i]<=100


Example:
Input:
1
4 6
6 9 4 2

Output:
2

Explanation:
The subsets are {4,2} and {6}
