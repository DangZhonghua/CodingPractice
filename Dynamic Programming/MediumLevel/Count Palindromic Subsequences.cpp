Count Palindromic Subsequences

https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-palindromic-subsequences/1/?ref=self

Given a string str, your task is to complete the function countPs which takes a string str as its only argument and returns an integer denoting the no of palindromic subsequence (need not necessarily be distinct) which could be formed from the string str.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the no of test cases then T test cases follow. Each test case contains a string str.

Output:
For each test case output will be an integer denoting the no of palindromic subsequence which could be formed from the string str.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=length of string str <=30

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input:
2
abcd
aab

Output:
4
4

Explanation:
For the first test case
palindromic subsequence are : "a" ,"b", "c" ,"d"

For second test case
palindromic subsequence are :"a", "a", "b", "aa"
