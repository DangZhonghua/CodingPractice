Dimensions of Rectangle 
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/dimensions-of-rectangle/0/?ref=self

You are required to build some sheets of rectangular shape of Area A. To build a sheet of an  Area A of Dimensions L & B. You have two conditions:
1) L and B can not be in decimals.
2) When L and B are even, L must be Equal to B.
Calculate the number of possible choices to build a sheet of area A

Input:
First line contains the number of test-cases T. Following "T" lines will contain a single integer A.

Output:
Output the count of different possible choices

Constraints:

1<=T<100
1<=A<=10^5

Example:

Input :

3
6
4
7

Output :

2
2
1

Note: Order of L and B does not matter, i.e., 3 x 2 is same as 2 x 3. Hence, it is to be counted only once.
