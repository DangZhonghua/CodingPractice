https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/length-longest-balanced-subsequence/
Given a string S, find the length of longest balanced subsequence in it. A balanced string is defined as:-

    A Null string is a balanced string.
    If X and Y are balanced strings, then (X)Y and XY are balanced strings.

Examples :

Input : S = "()())"
Output : 4

()() is the longest balanced subsequence 
of length 4.

Input : s = "()(((((()"
Output : 4
