Given a floor of dimensions 2 x W and tiles of dimensions 2 x 1, write code to 
find the number of ways the floor can be tiled. 
A tile can either be placed horizontally i.e as a 1 x 2 tile or vertically i.e as 2 x 1 tile.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is W.

Output:

Print number of ways the floor can be tiled in a separate line.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ W ≤ 70

Example:

Input
2
5
3

Output
8
3
