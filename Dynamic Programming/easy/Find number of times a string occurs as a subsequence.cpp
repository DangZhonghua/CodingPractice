Given two strings S1 and S2, find the number of times the second string occurs in the first string, whether continuous or discontinuous.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains integers N and M denoting the length of the strings S1 and S2 respectively.

The second line of each test case contains the strings S1 and S2.

Output:

Print the number of times S2 appears in S1, whether continuous or discontinuous. Print the answer for each test case in a new line.


Constraints:

1<= T <=100

1<= N, M <=1000
