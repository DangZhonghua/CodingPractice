Minimum cost to make Longest Common Subsequence of length k

Given two string X, Y and an integer k. Now the task is to convert string X with minimum cost such that 
the Longest Common Subsequence of X and Y after conversion is of length k. 
The cost of conversion is calculated as XOR of old character value and new character value. 
Character value of ‘a’ is 0, ‘b’ is 1 and so on
