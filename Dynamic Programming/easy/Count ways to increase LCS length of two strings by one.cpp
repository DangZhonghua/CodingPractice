Given two strings of lower alphabet characters, we need to find the number of ways to insert a character 
in the first string such that length of LCS of both strings increases by one.

 

Input:

The first line of the contains T denoting the number of testcases. Then T testcases follow. 
The first line of each test case contains integers N and M denoting the length of strings str1 and str2.
The second line of each test case contains the strings str1 and str2 consisiting of only lower case alphabets.


Output:

Print the answer for each test case in a new line.


Constraints:

1<= T <=100

1<= N, M <=100


Example:

Input:

1

5 3

abab abc

Output:

3
