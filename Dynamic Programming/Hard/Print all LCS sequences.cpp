You are given two strings a and b. Now your task is to print all longest common sub-sequences in lexicographical order.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer denoting the no of test cases T. Then T test case follow each test case contains 2 space separated strings a and b.

Output:
For each test case in a new line  print the space separated sequences.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=length of strings a and b<=100

Example:
Input:
2
abaaa baabaca
aaa a
Output:
aaaa abaa baaa
a
