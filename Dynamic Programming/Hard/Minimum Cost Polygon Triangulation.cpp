Minimum Cost Polygon Triangulation
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-cost-polygon-triangulation/

A triangulation of a convex polygon is formed by drawing diagonals between non-adjacent vertices (corners) 
such that the diagonals never intersect. The problem is to find the cost of triangulation with the minimum cost. 
The cost of a triangulation 
is sum of the weights of its component triangles. Weight of each triangle is its perimeter (sum of lengths of all sides)
