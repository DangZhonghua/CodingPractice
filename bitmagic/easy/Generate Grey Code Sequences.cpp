Generate Grey Code Sequences 
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/generate-grey-code-sequences/1

Given a number N, your task is to complete the function which generates all n-bit grey code sequences, a grey code sequence is a sequence such that successive patterns in it differ by one bit.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N.

Output:
For each test case in print the generated grey code sequences separated by space.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=N<=10

Example(To be used for expected output):
Input:
2
2
1

Output:
00 01 11 10
0 1
