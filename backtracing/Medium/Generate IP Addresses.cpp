Generate IP Addresses 

Given a string s containing only digits, Your task is to complete the function genIp 
which returns a vector containing all possible combination of valid IPv4 ip address 
and takes only a string s as its only argument . 
Note : Order doesn't matter

For string 11211 the ip address possible are 
1.1.2.11
1.1.21.1
1.12.1.1
11.2.1.1

Input:
The first line of input will contain no of test cases T. Then T test cases follow . Each test case will contains a string s . 

Output:
The output in the expected output will be 1 if successfully all the combinations 
were obtained in the returned vector else it will be 0.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=str<=16

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input
1
1111

Output
1

Please note that it's Function problem i.e.
you need to write your solution in the form of Function(s) only.
Driver Code to call/invoke your function is mentioned above.

You are required to complete this method
