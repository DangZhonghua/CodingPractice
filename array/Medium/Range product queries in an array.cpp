Range product queries in an array
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/range-product-queries-in-an-array/
We have an array of integers and a set of range queries. For every query, we need to find product of elements in the given range.

Input : arr[] = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25}   
        queries[] = {(3, 5), (2, 2), (2, 3)}
Output : 7500, 10, 150
7500 = 10 x 15 x 20
10 = 10
150 = 10 x 15
