Minimum product in a grid of adjacent elements

Given an N x M grid. The task is to find the minimum product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction 
(up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the matrix.

Examples:

Input : mat[][] = {1, 2, 3, 4,
                   5, 6, 7, 8,
                   9, 10, 11, 12}  
Output : 700 

2*5*7*10 gives output as 700 which is the smallest 
product possible 

Input :{7, 6, 7, 9
        1, 2, 3, 4
        1, 2, 3, 6,
        5, 6, 7, 1}   

Output: 36
