k smallest elements in same order using O(1) extra space
You are given an array of n-elements you have to find k smallest elements from the array 
but they must be in the same order as they are in given array and we are allowed to use only O(1) extra space.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {4, 2, 6, 1, 5}, 
            k = 3
Output : 4 2 1
Explanation : 1, 2 and 4 are three smallest 
numbers and 4 2 1 is their order in given array

Input : arr[] = {4, 12, 16, 21, 25}, 
            k = 3
Output : 4 12 16
Explanation : 4, 12 and 16 are 3 smallest numbers
and 4 12 16 is their order in given array
