Given two integers ‘L’ and ‘R’, write a program that finds the count of numbers having prime number of set bits in their binary representation in the range [L, R].

Input:
The first line consists of an integer T i.e number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case consists of two integers L and R. 

Output:
Print the required output.

Constraints: 
1<=T<=100
1<=L<=R<=100000

Example:
Input:
2
6 10
10 15 

Output:
4
5
