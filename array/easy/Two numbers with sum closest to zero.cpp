https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/two-numbers-with-sum-closest-to-zero/0/?ref=self

Given an integer array, you need to find the two elements such that their sum is closest to zero.
 
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.  
The first line of each test case is N,the size of array
Each test case consist of a N integers which are the array elements.
 
Output:
Print the two numbers in ascending order such that their sum is closest to zero.
 
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
-100007 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100007
 
Example:
Input
3
3
-8 -66 -60  
6
-21 -67 -37 -18 4 -65  
2
-24 -73  
 
Output
-60 -8
-18 4
