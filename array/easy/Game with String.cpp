Given a string of lowercase alphabets and a number k, the task is to print the minimum value of the string after removal of ‘k’ characters. The value of a string is defined as the sum of squares of the count of each distinct character.
Example:
Input : str = abccc, K = 1
Output : 6
We remove c to get the value as 1^1 + 1^1 + 2^2

Input:
First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of String s. Second line of every test case consists of a integer K.

Output:
Single line output, Print the minimum square sum.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=|String length|<=100

Example:
Input:
2
abccc
1
abccc
2
Output:
6
3
