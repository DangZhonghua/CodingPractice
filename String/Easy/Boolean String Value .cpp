Boolean String Value 


Given a string consisting of only 0, 1, A, B, C where
A = AND
B = OR
C = XOR
Calculate the value of the string assuming no order of precedence and evaluation is done from left to right.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The next T lines contains T strings.

Output:

Print the value of the string assuming no order of precedence and evaluation is done from left to right

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ length(string)<=1000


Examples:
Input : 
1
1A0B1

Output : 1
 

1 AND 0 OR 1 = 1

Input : 
2
1C1B1B0A0
1A0B1

Output : 
0
1
