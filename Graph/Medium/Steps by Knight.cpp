Steps by Knight 

Given a square chessboard of N x N size, the position of Knight and position of a target is given. We need to find out minimum steps a Knight will take to reach the target position.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer n denoting the size of the square chessboard. The next line contains the X-Y coordinates of the knight. The next line contains the X-Y coordinates of the target. 

Output:
Print the minimum steps the Knight will take to reach the target position.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=20
1<=knight_pos,targer_pos<=N

Example:
Input:
