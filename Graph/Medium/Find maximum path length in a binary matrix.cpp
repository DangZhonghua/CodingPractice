Find maximum path length in a binary matrix
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-path-length-in-a-binary-matrix/

Given a square matrix mat every element of which is either 0 or 1. A value 1 means connected and 0 means not connected. The task is to find the largest length of a path in the matrix after changing atmost one 0 to 1. A path is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.

Examples:

    Input: mat[][] = {{1, 1}, {1, 0}}
    Output: 4
    Change the only 0 to 1 and the length of the largest path will be 4.

    Input: mat[][] = {{1, 1}, {1, 1}}
    Output: 4
