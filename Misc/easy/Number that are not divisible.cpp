You will be given a positive integer N. Your task is to find the number of positive integers K ≤ N such that K is not divisible by any number among the set {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.

 

Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Then T test cases follow. The first and only line of each test case consists of N.
 

Output:
Corresponding to each test case, in a new line, print the number positive integers less than or equal to N which are not divisible by any number from 2 to 10.

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ N ≤ 1018
 

Example:

Input
3
200
400
500

Output
47
91
115
