Arrange Balls
There are ‘p’ balls of type P, ‘q’ balls of type Q and ‘r’ balls of type R. Using the balls we want to create a straight line such that no two balls of same type are adjacent.

Input:
First line of input contains number of test cases T. Each line of test case contains number of balls of each type seperated by a single space.

Output:
Number of ways to arrange balls are displayed and 0 is displayed if there are no ways.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 30
1 <= p,q,r <= 9

Example:

Input:
2
2 2 2
1 1 1

Output:
30
6
