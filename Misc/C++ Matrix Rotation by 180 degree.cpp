C++ Matrix Rotation by 180 degree 
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/c-matrix-rotation-by-180-degree/0/?ref=self

Given a square matrix  M of N X N, turn it by 180 degrees in anticlockwise direction without using extra memory.

Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer N, where N is the size of the square matrix.The second line of each test case contains NxN space-separated values of the matrix M.

Output:
For each test case, the output is the rotated matrix M. 

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=10

Example:
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
Output:
16 15 14 13
12 11 10 9
8 7 6 5
4 3 2 1
