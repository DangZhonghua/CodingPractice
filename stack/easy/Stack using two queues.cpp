Stack using two queues
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/stack-using-two-queues/1

Implement a Stack using 2 queue q1 and q2 .

Input (To be used for Expected Output):

The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries . 
A Query Q is of 2 Types
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the stack)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop element from stack and print the poped element)

The second line of each test case contains Q queries seperated by space.

Output:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers having -1 if the stack is empty else the element poped out from the stack . 
You are required to complete the two methods push which take one argument an integer 'x' to be pushed into the stack  and pop which returns a integer poped out from the stack.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=Q<=100
1<=x<=100

Example:
Input
1
5
1 2 1 3 2 1 4 2   

Output
3 4

Explanation:

In the first test case for query 
1 2    the stack will be {2}
1 3    the stack will be {2 3}
2       poped element will be 3 the stack will be {2}
1 4    the stack will be {2 4}
2       poped element will be 4
